Ayy thank you for downloading.

If anyone out there does not know how to install this skin, it's quite the easy process. 

Step 1. Locate your Friday Night Funkin folder, go to assets and then images.
Step 2. Rename or move the images that match the names of the mod images in the folder.
Step 3. Drag and drop the images in this folder into the images folder. (Including .xml files)
Step 4. Also drag and drop bfChristmas.png in the christmas folder. Depending on how much you wanna see Cartman's face.
Step 5. Laugh and cry. (peter giffin xD)
