We're Animanie--Totally insane-y
It's time for Animaniacs--And we're zany to the max
Just sit back and relax--You'll laugh till you collapse
Join the Warner Brothers--And the Warner Sister Dot
We're Animanie--Friday Nightly Funky
The nations of the world--United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, 
Dunno know what to say--the monkeys won't do
They're laboratory mice--Their genes, spliced
Watch out, my funky friend--OR ONE WILL FALL ON YOU
When your face is long--Sing the Acme Song
When they hit the street--Looking for food to eat
They flew their ranch rover--To the city's neon glow
She's walkin' down--Everybody turns around
Whose fault?--Whose fault?
Are we there yet?--I'm tired
What if--What if
We're clear and absolute--What we are, dear doctor
Her family knows--that anytime soon...
I bet you all are wondering--Who is this young unknown?
They have different language they speak--By folks who went for one week.
Make that social climb--Spend a good time!
You don't act like the others--You wear a disguise
For a guaranteed smash-- dig it up out of the trash
She's grumpy, he's happy,--It's generation gappy
Just try it--you'll see
You see in matters comical--unusual and whimsical
It doesn't make any sense--Nonsense!
If your host throws you out,--There's no need for you to pout.
Don't copy someone else--Being you is a singular delight!
Maybe next time,--we'll just sing Jingle Bells!
Go ahead--make a gookie!
Between Bolivia and Peru,--Waters tranquil and blue.
He's going shopping--So let's get hopping
Today's the day-- we're on our way
Pa rump pa pa pum--Me and my drum
